# UniverSity-Resitor
This for assesment for my campus.. it must be base on OOP concept not a simple java coding.. 


University Registration System 
 
1. System should allow to add lecturers and students (at least 10 students and 5 lectures) 2. Also, it should allow to maintain degree programs. And each of the program can consists of many modules. 3. The registered students should be able to enroll with the degree programs and each module should have module leader who is a lecturer. 4. Then, for each module will consist of a CW and a final examination and lecturer should be able to add relevant marks for each module respectively. 5. Then add a menu system, which allow the user to choose what they want to select. Enter an ‘S’ to add a student, and a ‘L’ add a lecturer. (To do a menu see the ‘arith’ program in the notes about ‘Ifs’ from last semester – or see the ‘arith’ program code which is towards the start of the code examples) When a ‘S’ or ‘L’ is pressed it should do the Add procedure, a ‘VS’ and ‘VL’ should do the View procedure for student and lecturer respectively. Add procedure should allow students to degree programs as well. Similarly add lecturer procedure should also allow to assign lecturer to the unassigned modules. 6. One by one, add extra procedures to do each of the following. The user should be able to choose from the menu what the program does. 7. D: Add a degree program 8. DL: View degree programs 9. M: Add a module 10. ML: View modules 11. A: Add marks for a students 12. CM: Calculate module average mark. This should be for all the students and display as below; 
 
Module: M001 – Programming Principle 2 
 
Name   CW  Examination  Average 
 
Saman Perera  63  58   61 Gayan Lakmal  45  33   39 James Dan  75  76   76 
 
13. SD: Then, the above result should be saved to a text file with the following naming module_name.txt 
 
Note: Solution should be java console applications (not windows application). And please use the proper OOP concepts as necessary.
